## Testing SvelteKit

This is my first contact with Svelte/SvelteKit.

My personal roadmap to test and learning is:

1. Learn how initiate new project.
2. Learn how use bootstrap with this and upload to GitHub.
3. Build the structure from CRUD app.
4. Apply styles.
5. Connect with a REST API to data persistence.
6. Test the complete application.
7. Celebrate that everything works correctly.
8. Make the project public.
